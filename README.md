## ðŸ“– The Journey Behind This MVP

Over the last 2 months, I worked on building my first real-world React project: a task management app.

At first, I completed the design and styles. But when I started implementing the logic, I struggled. The problem?  
- I didn't have a solid foundation in modern JavaScript (spread operator, array/object methods, etc.)
- I was just starting to learn React and hadnâ€™t fully internalized key concepts like:
  - Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
  - Props and component communication
  - Lifting state up
  - Handling events
  - Controlled inputs
  - Basic project structure

But I **did not give up**. I studied, practiced, broke the code many times â€” and rebuilt it.

Today, this MVP represents not just a small project â€” it represents the foundation of my growth as a frontend developer.
